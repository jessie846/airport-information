Steps on how to create a airport for the project.

1. You can message me on discord @Jessie846 #3179 and ask to be added to the dev team. Or you can email me @jakesmith45751@gmail.com.

2. Once you are added to the developer team you should check if the airport you were going to do has been created in the issues tab. If it has but has not been 
completed you can complete it with the person. If it is already completed you are out of luck and have to do a different airport.

3. If the airport you are going to do has not been created you should follow these steps you created it:

1. In the Issues tab create a new issue which is in the format Add (ICAO code) - (Airport Name), for example Add KMCO - Orlando INTL Airport.
2. Next when you get into the code you should in the Airports folder create a folder that is the ICAO of the airport.
3. Inside that airport you should create 10 files. When you see ICAO that is used to reference your airport ICAO code not just ICAO. Create these 10 files:
icao.html, icao.css, icaocharts.html, icaocharts.css, icaoweather.html, icaoweather.css, icaorunways.html, icaorunways.css, icaoposition.html, icaoposition.css
4. Next you should follow the code in the reference document, and update the information for the airport. Note: You should update the picture to be of the airport. AN 
easy way to get a picture is load up into a simulator find a good picture, take it clicking CTRL + SHIFT + S, it should take a screenshot if not you can use snipping 
tool. It should have the picture in your clipboard, you can paste it into a discord server, and copy the image link and you can paste it into the html. 
5. You have free range to change the colors, and style of the document if you know what you are doing and the file still looks acceptable.
